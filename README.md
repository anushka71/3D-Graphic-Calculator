# 3D-Graphic-Calculator

This is a project I created in highschool during the early stages of learning C++. I used MS-DOS/Turbo C++ to create this menu-driven program and used the in-built graphics library which enabled me to add visualizations for the common three-dimensional figures. 

The user can choose from a list of 3D figures and specify the one they wish to find the surface area and volume of. The program then prompts the user to input desired dimensions of the figure, after which a visual of that specific figure is generated and the computed values are displayed on the screen.

This program is functional, but at the same time itâ€™s user-friendly and visually appealing. The user-specified input makes the program interactive and the graphics enhance the visual/design aspect of the program.
