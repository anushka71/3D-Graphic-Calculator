# 3D-Graphic-Calculator

This is a project I created in highschool during the early stages of learning C++. I used MS-DOS/Turbo C++ which comes with an in-built graphics library that enabled me to add visualizations for the common three-dimensional figures. 

The user can specify the figure they wish to find the surface area and volume of, input desired dimensions of the figure, and view the visual of that specific figure along with the computed values.

This program is functional, but at the same time itâ€™s user-friendly and visually appealing. The user-specified input makes the program interactive and the graphics enhance the visual/design aspect of the program.
